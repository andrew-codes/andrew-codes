# Hi, ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Andrew and I empower others through quality software.

I aim to make software development more accessible to a wider audience. I accomplish this primarily through mentorship, OSS, and sharing my experiences.

## Core Values

**Growth mindset**: Be willing to begin again. Empty your cup. Embrace growth opportunities.

**Authentic Self**: strive to create safe environments and empower everyone to bring their authentic self to the table.

**Honesty**: Be honest and transparent.

**Simplicity**: Favor simple solutions over easy ones.

## Topics I find Interesting

I love working on [my home ops project](https://github.com/andrew-codes/home-ops) and an open-source, self-hosted application for game management, [Playnite Web](https://github.com/andrew-codes/playnite-web). Applied design principles and patterns. Gaming; mostly PC, some PlayStation. Elixir and functional programming. Science and philosophy. Mentorship and teaching technical concepts.

## Ask Me About

Feel free to ask me about simple and easy, any of my interests, or just to talk tech. I'm always seeking individuals with a passion to learn more improve their craft.

## Goals

- Dedicate time each week to learn about Elixir

## Connect With Me

I do not favor unexpected phone calls. I prefer to chat in public forums, so information can be more easily shared. I strive to be available to answer questions, pair program, etc.
