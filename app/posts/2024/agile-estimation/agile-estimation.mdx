## Overview

Estimating is a common practice in Agile software development. It's a way to help teams understand the relative size of work and to help with prioritization. However, estimating can be a time-consuming process and often leads to inaccurate forecasts; making it an ineffective means to enable planning. In this post, I'll discuss the purpose of estimates and introduce a more effective way to forecast project timelines.

## Why do we Estimate?

This may appear to be self-evident, but the reason we estimate is often as misunderstood as it is misued. How many of us agree with the following statemet? "Estimating help us know how much effort it will take to complete some backlog of work. Understanding how much work there is is the only way to know how long it will take to complete it."

> Estimation is a poor planning tool and this is not its primary purpose.

In my experience this is a rather commmonly held belief. However, estimation is very poor and often inaccurate at predicting the future. Ancetodally, we can easily reason through this statement. Our estimates simply cannot account for the various unknowns of the work and external factors that arise during the course of a project. We do try to force a square peg into a round hole by spending more time trying to undertsand the work without doing the work. This is a common pitfall with estimation.

I can also support the claim that estimation is poor at predicting the future through empirical evidence. If estimates were effective, this insinuates projects planned by estimates should consistently meet their deadlines <strong>and</strong> adhere closely to the original planned timelines. Over my career, working at varying companies of varying teams of varying sizes, I have not seen a consistent track record meeting both criteria. In fact, I have seen the opposite. Timelines or scope are often adjusted to meet deadlines; sometimes missing them all together. The adjustments simply indicate the original timeline was not accurate enough to be maintained. This is not to say that estimation is the sole reason for this, but certainly can be a contributing factor as more time and focus is spent on estimating/planning than delivering.

There are certainly more tried and tested mechanisms to forecast project timelines; of which I will discuss later in this article. However, the purpose of estimating stories is not a tool for planning. Departing from this belief may leave you wondering, "what is the purpose of estimating stories?" This is the whole reason I included this section.

### Why we "actually" estimate?

Simply put, the reason we estimate is to aid us in prioritization of work. "You can't put ten pounds of stuff into a five pound bag." The reality is there is more things to do than there is people, time, and money to do them. For this reason, we are always faced with trade-offs of work that is done and work that is not done. This is what prioritization is all about. However, how can we make informed decisions about what to work on next if we don't understand the relative size of the work? We cannot compare two bodies of work without knowing the relative cost of each one. This is where estimation becomes helpful.

> Estimation is helpful for prioritization of work by helping us understand the trade-offs of the work's value and relative cost.

Understanding that prioritization and not planning are drivers of estimation significnatly changes the way we approach estimating stories. We can now focus on the relative size of the work and not the absolute size. This is a key distinction that will help us make more informed decisions about what to work on next.

## Estimation Techniques for Priorization

> Guiding principles for estimation: just enough accuracy, minimize time spent estimating and relative size.

- <strong>Just enough accuracy</strong>: estimates should be accurate enough to
  help us make informed decisions about what to work on next and no more.
  Improved accuracy does not necessarily lead to improved decisions.
- <strong>Minimize time spent estimating</strong>: the time spent estimating
  should be minimized. The time spent estimating is time not spent delivering
  value. The goal is to spend the least amount of time estimating to make the
  most informed decisions.
- <strong>Relative Size</strong>: estimates should be relative to one another.
  This is the most important aspect of estimation. We are not trying to
  understand the absolute size of the work, but the relative size of the work.
  This is what helps us make informed decisions about what to work on next.

### Story Points

Story points are a unit of measure that is relative to one another. This is what makes them effective for prioritization. We can compare two bodies of work and understand the relative cost of each one. With this said, notice the absence of a work's complexity in the definition of story points. This is because complexity is not a factor in prioritization. The complexity of the work is a factor in the work's effort, but not in the work's relative size.

Often, the Fibinacci sequence is used to assign story points to work. This is generally because the sequence is exponential and not linear. Ideally, it helps prevent engineers from becoming too bogged down in details. Remember, the principles are to gain the most help with prioritization with the least effort possible. Minute sizings differences of similarly sized work rarely impact priority. However, doubling or quadrupling the work's size does.

> Streamline story points into 3 buckets: small, large, and too large.

Another common practice is to use only 3 different values for story points. Work is categorized into 2 primary buckets; small and large. The small bucket is for work that looks like all other "normal" work. The large bucket is for any work that is significantly larger than the small bucket. The third bucket is for any work that does not fit into the first two buckets. This is an indication that the work is not well understood and should be broken down further. By simply using these three values, we can quickly and easily estimate work without getting bogged down in the details.
