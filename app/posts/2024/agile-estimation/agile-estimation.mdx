## Overview

Estimating is a common practice in Agile software development. It's a way to help teams understand the relative size of work and to help with prioritization. However, estimating can be a time-consuming process and often leads to inaccurate forecasts; making it an ineffective means to enable planning. In this post, I'll discuss the purpose of estimation and I'll speak speak about a more effective way to forecast project timelines in an upcoming article.

## Why do we Estimate?

This may appear to be self-evident, but the reason we estimate is often as misunderstood as it is misused. How many of us agree with the following statement? <em>"Estimating helps us know how much effort it will take to complete some backlog of work. Understanding how much work there is is the only way to know how long it will take to complete it."</em> In my experience this is a rather commonly held belief. However, estimation is very poor and often inaccurate at predicting the future.

> Estimation is a poor planning tool and this is not its primary purpose.

Anecdotally, we can easily reason through this statement. If estimates were effective, then projects planned by estimates should consistently meet their deadlines <strong>and</strong> adhere closely to the original planned timelines. Over my career, working at varying companies with varying teams of varying sizes, I have not seen a consistent track record meeting both criteria. In fact, I have seen the opposite. Timelines or scope are often adjusted to meet deadlines; sometimes missing them altogether. The adjustments simply indicate the original timeline was not accurate enough to be maintained. This is not to say that estimation is the sole reason for this, but certainly can be a contributing factor as more time and focus is spent on estimating/planning than delivering.

I can also support this claim with empirical evidence. Unfortuntaely, I am not at liberty to release any of the supporting data at this time. However, I encourage the reader to look through their own historical data for their teams and see if they can find a similar pattern. Remember, we want to compare original estimates to actual delivery dates without any adjustments to the scope of the project.

There are certainly more tried and tested mechanisms to forecast project timelines; of which I will discuss later in this article. However, the purpose of estimating stories is not a tool for planning. Departing from this belief may leave you wondering, <em>"what is the purpose of estimating stories?"</em> This is the whole reason I included this section.

### Why we "actually" estimate?

<em>"You can't put ten pounds of stuff into a five-pound bag."</em> The reality
is there is more things to do than there is people, time, and money to do them.
For this reason, we are always faced with trade-offs of work that is done and
work that is not done.

> Estimation is helpful for prioritization of work by helping us understand the trade-offs of the work's value and relative cost.

This is what prioritization is all about. However, how
can we make informed decisions about what to work on next if we don't understand
the relative size of the work? We cannot compare two bodies of work without
knowing the relative cost of each one. This is where estimation becomes helpful.

Understanding that prioritization and not planning are drivers of estimation significantly changes the way we approach estimating stories. We can now focus on the relative size of the work and not the absolute size. This is a key distinction that will help us make more informed decisions about what to work on next.

## Estimation Techniques for Priorization

> Guiding principles for estimation: just enough accuracy, minimize time spent estimating and relative size.

1. <strong>Just enough accuracy</strong>: estimates should be accurate enough to
   help us make informed decisions about what to work on next and no more.
   Improved accuracy does not necessarily lead to improved decisions.
2. <strong>Minimize time spent estimating</strong>: the time spent estimating
   should be minimized. The time spent estimating is time not spent delivering
   value. The goal is to spend the least amount of time estimating to make the
   most informed decisions.
3. <strong>Relative Size</strong>: estimates should be relative to one another.
   This is the most important aspect of estimation. We are not trying to
   understand the absolute size of the work, but the relative size of the work.
   This is what helps us make informed decisions about what to work on next.

### Skip Story Points

Story points are often a hotly contested topic among engineers. There is often a lack of consensus on the unit of measurement, the scale, and what the value represents; e.g., effort, complexity, time. This immediately lands teams in a quagmire of debate and discussion and quickly can derail any estimation session; thus violating the second principle I've outlined above. I am not going to define what a story point is or represents. Instead, I am going to suggest that we skip story points. Here are a few reasons to skip story points.

> Reasons to skip story points: they often are a source of confusion and debate, require a great upfront cost for larger bodies of work and reduce agility.

1. Story points are often used as a measure of effort, complexity, and time. This can lead to confusion and debate over what the value represents.
2. Lack of clarity into the unit's definition leads to inaccurate and inconsistent estimates.
3. Story points require a great upfront cost for larger bodies of work. This time not only could be spent delivering value, but also reduces agility as the upfront cost is lost if there's a need to pivot to a different body of work.

A note on the third item. To utilize story points for a larger body means one of two things: 1) a single story that is large or 2) a collection of related stories. In the first case, the story is likely not well understood and should be broken down further. This inevitably means the first case will become the second case. In the second case, all related stories must be estimated in order to gain insight into the larger body of work. Keep in mind that we estimate to prioritize, meaning we cannot understand how to prioritize this body of work against others until both undergo this process. This is a significant upfront cost. This reduces agility in two ways. First, it increases time to delivery as we must estimate all related stories. Second, it reduces the ability to pivot to a different body of work as the upfront cost is lost.

### Use a Bucketing Approach

A more effective estimation practice is to use a bucketing system. This means estimate values are one of only a few choices. This helps streamline the estimation process and reduces the time spent estimating.

> Streamline estimates into 3 buckets: small, large, and too large.

1. <strong>small</strong>: work that looks like all other "normal" work.
2. <strong>large</strong>: work that is unusually larger than the small bucket.
3. <strong>too large</strong>: work that does not fit into the first two
   buckets. This is an indication that the work is not well understood and
   should be broken down further.

Additionally, comparing unknown work to only 2 buckets is easier than comparing it to larger range of values. This expidites the speed at which estimation can occur which is a key principle of estimation: minimize time spent estimating.

> The process of bucketing also reduces the spread of estimates. This is a good thing. The spread of estimates is an indication that the work is not well understood.

Overtime, bucketing will begin to reduce the spread of estimates. In other words, the estimates will begin to converge. Work will either be one of two sizes. If not, then work is broken down until it becomes one of the two sizes. This is a good thing. It means the work is becoming better understood. This is the goal of estimation: to understand the relative size of the work.

## Final Thoughts

There is one gap in this article that I have not addressed. I have not discussed how to forecast project timelines. This is a critical piece of the puzzle that I will address in an upcoming article. However, I hope I have convinced you that estimation is not the tool for planning. Instead, it is a tool for prioritization. Understanding this distinction will help you make more informed decisions about what to work on next.
